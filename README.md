Cosmic Ray Detector OSC Output for ESP32-S3 using a device from https://cosmicray.com.au/ built by Robert 

Change network details and target IP address for the OSC version

The Max patch is an example of communicating to and from the cosmic ray detector

There is also code for using the detector with a Teensy 4.1 which then outputs USB MIDI as well as a digital gate output for triggering a modular synth
